## Important

No need to edit the changelog ever, it's generated automatically.

## Documentation Language

Write all documentation in Korean (한글). This applies to new docs and to edits
of existing docs (`docs/**`, in-repo guides, and prose sections you add to the
main `README.md`).

- Exception: the main `README.md` is English-first with per-language translations
  under `docs/i18n/` — do not convert the whole file to Korean. Korean prose
  belongs in `docs/i18n/README.ko.md` (and any new sections you author may be
  written in Korean per the user's request).
- Keep code identifiers, env var names, CLI commands, and file paths in their
  original form; translate only the surrounding prose.

## Daily Maintenance

Run a daily version check across all package manifests and upgrade every dependency to its latest version — including major version bumps. Staying on the latest is the goal; do not skip majors.

- Check `package.json` (root) and all nested `package.json` files (e.g. `plugin/`, `openclaw/`) for outdated dependencies via `npm outdated`.
- Upgrade every package to `latest` (use `npm install <pkg>@latest` for each, or `npx npm-check-updates -u && npm install`). Bump majors too.
- Run `npm audit fix` to resolve advisories.
- After upgrades, run `npm run build-and-sync` and verify the worker starts and tests pass. Fix any breakage caused by major bumps in the same change.
- Commit the updated `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files.
